# NOTICE: Someone/Something is performing automated scanning and costing me $100+ per day, and Google is shutting nutTRACKR down.

\* sigh *

I don't have the time any time in the next few weeks to do a root cause analysis, but someone or something is hitting the site with an insane number of requests. Google is shutting down nutTRACKR because I have billing limits set up based on how much on average it costs to run the site, and the last few days have skyrocketed to >= $100 USD PER DAY to keep the site online. I cannot afford this, and I cannot fix it in the near term. Google has taken the billing limit as a refusal to pay the bill, and I have received an email telling me that the site will be suspended. I am sorry. 

I have a backup of all your nut data - if I can find time to figure out this issue and how to prevent it, things MAY come back up, but the fastest thing I could do without draining my wallet was to shut things down entirely. I apologize for the lack of any advance notice. I am really, truly sorry.
